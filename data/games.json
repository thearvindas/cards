The rotation follows the acronym H.O.R.S.E.: Hold'em, Omaha Hi-Lo, Razz, Seven Card Stud, and Seven Card Stud Hi-Lo. Each variant is played for a predetermined number of hands (typically 8-10) before rotating to the next game. This format is popular in high-stakes tournaments because it prevents players from specializing in just one game type, requiring mastery of multiple poker variants. The game rewards well-rounded poker skills and adaptability.",

Each player receives 4 cards, and the goal is to collect four of a kind (all four cards of the same rank). Players take turns drawing from a central pile and discarding one card, trying to collect their four of a kind. The unique twist is that players must secretly signal their partner when they have four of a kind using pre-agreed signals (like touching your nose, winking, or other subtle gestures). When you notice your partner has four of a kind, you call 'Kemps!' to win the round. However, if you're wrong, the other team wins. The game requires careful observation to spot your partner's signals while avoiding detection by opponents, making it a test of both card skills and communication.",

      "description": "A variant of Briscola that adds a secret partnership element, making it a five-player game. One player (the caller) calls out a specific card that they do not have in their hand. The player who holds that card becomes the caller's secret partner, but this partnership is not revealed until the called card is actually played. The game follows standard Briscola rules: players use a 40-card deck, each receives cards, and players take tricks following suit when possible, with the trump suit determined by the last card dealt. The secret partnership adds a fascinating strategic element as players must try to identify who their partner is through gameplay while the other three players try to figure out the partnership. The first team to reach the target score wins.",

The game uses two decks (104 cards total), and 54 cards are dealt into 10 columns with the top card of each column face up.

With only two suits, players must match suits when building sequences, but it's easier than the four-suit variant since there are fewer suit conflicts.

      "description": "A flexible poker format where the dealer chooses which poker variant to play for each hand, creating variety and testing players' knowledge of different poker games. The dealer can choose any poker variant (Hold'em, Omaha, Seven Card Stud, Five Card Draw, or any other variant). The choice rotates with each hand as the dealer button moves. This format rewards players who are skilled in multiple poker variants rather than specializing in just one. It prevents any single player from dominating by being an expert in just one game type, and it keeps the game interesting with constant variety. Dealer's Choice is extremely popular in home games and creates a fun, dynamic poker experience.",

      "description": "A partnership variant of Écarté, a classic French trick-taking game, adapted for four players. The game is played by four players in partnerships (two teams of two) using a 32-card deck. Each player receives 5 cards, and the next card is turned up to determine the trump suit. Players can exchange cards with the stock pile before play begins. Players then take tricks following suit when possible, with the highest card of the led suit or the highest trump winning the trick. The first team to reach 5 points wins the game. Écarté Partnership adds the strategic element of partnership play to the classic two-player game, requiring coordination between partners.",
